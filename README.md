## About The Project

This is the third project from [The Odin Project's Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations), titled ['Rock Paper Scissors'](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

My learnings from this project include:
* Creating a simple browser console game using JavaScript
* Using functions to create reusable blocks of code
* Problem solving using the browser debugger and **console.log()**
* Version control using Git and GitHub
